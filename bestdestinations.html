            <h2>New-York</h2>
            <p>New York, the city that never sleeps! This city in the United States bustles day and night and there
                is something to do on every street corner. The dizzying skyscrapers, Central Park and the number of
                examples of highlights in The Big Apple. During a city trip in New York, get on your bike and
                discover the Harlem district full of soul or plan a shopping session. You will find plenty of shops
                here!</p>

            <h2>Los Angeles</h2>
            <p>When you think of a holiday in Los Angeles, you probably immediately think of the American film
                industry with the famous city of Hollywood ofcourse. In addition to a attractions such as the Walk
                of Fame or the Hollywood Sign, this major California city is home to a variety of attractions such
                as some popular beaches such as Venice Beach and theme parks such as Six Flags and Universal
                Studios.</p>

            <h2>San Francisco</h2>
            <p>A jumbled collage of colorful neighborhoods and beautiful views, San Francisco draws those
                free-spirited types who have an eye for edgy art, a taste for imaginative cuisine and a zeal for
                adventure. It's really not surprising that songwriter Tony Bennett left his heart here: The city
                boasts jaw-dropping sights, world-class cuisine, cozy cafes and plenty of booming nightlife venues –
                there's no shortage of ways to stay busy here. Spend an hour or two sunning yourself alongside sea
                lions on the bay, admiring the views of the city from Twin Peaks, or strolling along the Marina.</p>

                have seen the Eiffel Tower at least once in their life or who must have sat on the steps in front of the

            <p>For days all about Spanish tapas, terraces, sun and beach... Doesn't sound wrong, does it? If you book a
                city trip to Barcelona, you can combine beach with city! One of the highlights is the Sagrada Familia.
