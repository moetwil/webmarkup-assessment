            <h2>Los Angeles</h2>

            <h2>San Francisco</h2>
            <p>A jumbled collage of colorful neighborhoods and beautiful views, San Francisco draws those
                free-spirited types who have an eye for edgy art, a taste for imaginative cuisine and a zeal for
                adventure. It's really not surprising that songwriter Tony Bennett left his heart here: The city
                boasts jaw-dropping sights, world-class cuisine, cozy cafes and plenty of booming nightlife venues –
                there's no shortage of ways to stay busy here. Spend an hour or two sunning yourself alongside sea
                lions on the bay, admiring the views of the city from Twin Peaks, or strolling along the Marina.</p>
